This is a simple signup page which asks for the user's full name and his/her e-mail ID. This data is sent to the MailChimp servers using their API.
Express.js and Node.js at the back-end send requests and receive responses from the MailChimp servers. The collected data then can be easily used to increase the reach of our product.
